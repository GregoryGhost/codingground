Robinson was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, England in 1930[2] and left for the United States in 1952 with a classics degree from Cambridge University. He studied philosophy at the University of Oregon before moving to Princeton University where he received his PhD in philosophy in 1956. He then worked at Du Pont as an operations research analyst, where he learned programming and taught himself mathematics. He moved to Rice University in 1961, spending his summers as a visiting researcher at the Argonne National Laboratory's Applied Mathematics Division. He moved to Syracuse University as Distinguished Professor of Logic and Computer Science in 1967 and became professor emeritus in 1993.[citation needed]

It was at Argonne that Robinson became interested in automated theorem proving and developed unification and the resolution principle. Resolution and unification have since been incorporated in many automated theorem-proving systems and are the basis for the inference mechanisms used in logic programming and the programming language Prolog.

Robinson was the Founding Editor of the Journal of Logic Programming, and has received numerous honours. These include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967, the American Mathematical Society Milestone Award in Automatic Theorem Proving 1985,[3] an AAAI Fellowship 1990,[4] the Humboldt Senior Scientist Award 1995,[citation needed] the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automatic Reasoning 1996,[5][6] and the Association for Logic Programming honorary title Founder of Logic Programming in 1997.[7] He has received Honorary Doctorates from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven 1988,[8] Uppsala University 1994,[9] and Universidad Politecnica de Madrid 2003.[10][11] Robinson died in Portland, Maine on 5 August 2016 from a ruptured aneurysm following surgery for pancreatic cancer.[12]
